@article{Bytautas_2015,
	abstract = {The present study further explores the concept of the seniority number ($\Omega$) by examining different configuration interaction (CI) truncation strategies in generating compact wave functions in a systematic way. While the role of $\Omega$ in addressing static (strong) correlation problem has been addressed in numerous previous studies, the usefulness of seniority number in describing weak (dynamic) correlation has not been investigated in a systematic way. Thus, the overall objective in the present work is to investigate the role of $\Omega$ in addressing also dynamic electron correlation in addition to the static correlation. Two systematic CI truncation strategies are compared beyond minimal basis sets and full valence active spaces. One approach is based on the seniority number (defined as the total number of singly occupied orbitals in a determinant) and another is based on an excitation-level limitation. In addition, molecular orbitals are energy-optimized using multiconfigurational-self-consistent-field procedure for all these wave functions. The test cases include the symmetric dissociation of water (6-31G), N2 (6-31G), C2 (6-31G), and Be2 (cc-pVTZ). We find that the potential energy profile for H2O dissociation can be reasonably well described using only the $\Omega$ = 0 sector of the CI wave function. For the Be2 case, we show that the full CI potential energy curve (cc-pVTZ) is almost exactly reproduced using either $\Omega$-based (including configurations having up to $\Omega$ = 2 in the virtual-orbital-space) or excitation-based (up to single-plus-double-substitutions) selection methods, both out of a full-valence-reference function. Finally, in dissociation cases of N2 and C2, we shall also consider novel hybrid wave functions obtained by a union of a set of CI configurations representing the full valence space and a set of CI configurations where seniority-number restriction is imposed for a complete set (full-valence-space and virtual) of correlated molecular orbitals, simultaneously. We discuss the usefulness of the seniority number concept in addressing both static and dynamic electron correlation problems along dissociation paths.},

	abstract = {We present a configuration interaction method in which the Hamiltonian of an N-electron system is projected on Slater determinants selected according to the seniority-number criterion along with the traditional excitation-based procedure. This proposed method is especially useful to describe systems which exhibit dynamic (weak) correlation at determined geometric arrangements (where the excitation-based procedure is more suitable) but show static (strong) correlation at other arrangements (where the seniority-number technique is preferred). The hybrid method amends the shortcomings of both individual determinant selection procedures, yielding correct shapes of potential energy curves with results closer to those provided by the full configuration interaction method.},

@article{Alcoba_2014b,
	abstract = {This work deals with the configuration interaction method when an N-electron Hamiltonian is projected on Slater determinants which are classified according to their seniority number values. We study the spin features of the wave functions and the size of the matrices required to formulate states of any spin symmetry within this treatment. Correlation energies associated with the wave functions arising from the seniority-based configuration interaction procedure are determined for three types of molecular orbital basis: canonical molecular orbitals, natural orbitals, and the orbitals resulting from minimizing the expectation value of the N-electron seniority number operator. The performance of these bases is analyzed by means of numerical results obtained from selected N-electron systems of several spin symmetries. The comparison of the results highlights the efficiency of the molecular orbital basis which minimizes the mean value of the seniority number for a state, yielding energy values closer to those provided by the full configuration interaction procedure. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

@article{Burton_2022,
	abstract = {State-specific approximations can provide a more accurate representation of challenging electronic excitations by enabling relaxation of the electron density. While state-specific wave functions are known to be local minima or saddle points of the approximate energy, the global structure of the exact electronic energy remains largely unexplored. In this contribution, a geometric perspective on the exact electronic energy landscape is introduced. On the exact energy landscape, ground and excited states form stationary points constrained to the surface of a hypersphere, and the corresponding Hessian index increases at each excitation level. The connectivity between exact stationary points is investigated, and the square-magnitude of the exact energy gradient is shown to be directly proportional to the Hamiltonian variance. The minimal basis Hartree-Fock and excited-state mean-field representations of singlet H2(STO-3G) are then used to explore how the exact energy landscape controls the existence and properties of state-specific approximations. In particular, approximate excited states correspond to constrained stationary points on the exact energy landscape, and their Hessian index also increases for higher energies. Finally, the properties of the exact energy are used to derive the structure of the variance optimization landscape and elucidate the challenges faced by variance optimization algorithms, including the presence of unphysical saddle points or maxima of the variance.},

A computational scheme termed the spin-restricted ensemble-referenced Kohn--Sham (REKS) method is devised for these cases. An optimal set of orthonormal one-electron orbitals and their optimal occupation numbers are obtained from minimization of the ground state energy with respect to the density. The REKS method is applied to several model problems, rotation in C2H4, dissociation of H2, and the singlet-triplet energy gaps in substituted trimethylene diradicals.},

Instead of using the aufbau principle, the algorithm maximizes the overlap between the occupied orbitals on successive SCF iterations. This prevents variational collapse to the ground state and guides the SCF process toward the nearest, rather than the lowest energy, solution. The resulting excited-state solutions can be treated in the same way as the ground-state solution and, in particular, derivatives of excited-state energies can be computed using ground-state code. We assess the performance of our method by applying it to a variety of excited-state problems including the calculation of excitation energies, charge-transfer states, and excited-state properties. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The results are obtained by using the Initial Maximum Overlap Method (IMOM) which is a modified version of the Maximum Overlap Method (MOM). The new algorithm converges better than the original, especially for these difficult problems. By considering several case studies, we show that a single-determinant framework provides a simple and accurate alternative for modeling excited states in cases where other low-cost methods, such as CIS and TD-DFT, either perform poorly or fail completely.},

@article{Levi_2020,
	abstract = {The development of variational density functional theory approaches to excited electronic states is impeded by limitations of the commonly used self-consistent field (SCF) procedure. A method based on a direct optimization approach as well as the maximum overlap method is presented, and the performance is compared with previously proposed SCF strategies. Excited-state solutions correspond to saddle points of the energy as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. The approach presented here makes use of a preconditioner determined with the help of the maximum overlap method to guide the convergence on a target nth-order saddle point. This method is found to be more robust and converge faster than previously proposed SCF approaches for a set of 89 excited states of molecules. A limited-memory formulation of the symmetric rank-one method for updating the inverse Hessian is found to give the best performance. A conical intersection for the carbon monoxide molecule is calculated without resorting to fractional occupation numbers. Calculations on the excited states of the hydrogen atom and a doubly excited state of the dihydrogen molecule using a self-interaction corrected functional are presented. For these systems, the self-interaction correction is found to improve the accuracy of density functional calculations of excited states.},

The approach remains variational and entirely time independent, allowing it to avoid some of the difficulties associated with linear response and the adiabatic approximation. In particular, all of the electrons' orbitals are relaxed state specifically, and there is no reliance on Kohn-Sham orbital energy differences, both of which are important features in the context of charge transfer. Preliminary testing shows clear advantages for single-component charge transfer states, but the method, at least in its current form, is less reliable for states in which multiple particle-hole transitions contribute significantly.},

	abstract = {We develop a bivariational principle for an antisymmetric product of nonorthogonal geminals. Special cases reduce to the antisymmetric product of strongly-orthogonal geminals (APSG), the generalized valence bond-perfect pairing (GVB-PP), and the antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunctions. The presented method employs wavefunctions of the same type as Richardson-Gaudin (RG) states, but which are not eigenvectors of a model Hamiltonian which would allow for more freedom in the mean-field. The general idea is to work with the same state in a primal picture in terms of pairs, and in a dual picture in terms of pair-holes. This leads to an asymmetric energy expression which may be optimized bivariationally, and is strictly variational when the two representations agree. The general approach may be useful in other contexts, such as for computationally feasible variational coupled-cluster methods.},

	abstract = {Doubly occupied configuration interaction (DOCI) with optimized orbitals often accurately describes strong correlations while working in a Hilbert space much smaller than that needed for full configuration interaction. However, the scaling of such calculations remains combinatorial with system size. Pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) is very successful in reproducing DOCI energetically, but can do so with low polynomial scaling (N3, disregarding the two-electron integral transformation from atomic to molecular orbitals). We show here several examples illustrating the success of pCCD in reproducing both the DOCI energy and wave function and show how this success frequently comes about. What DOCI and pCCD lack are an effective treatment of dynamic correlations, which we here add by including higher-seniority cluster amplitudes which are excluded from pCCD. This frozen pair coupled cluster approach is comparable in cost to traditional closed-shell coupled cluster methods with results that are competitive for weakly correlated systems and often superior for the description of strongly correlated systems.},

	abstract = {This investigation combines the concept of the seniority number Ω (defined as the total number of singly occupied orbitals in a determinant) with the energy renormalization group (ERG) approach to obtain the lowest-energy electronic states on molecular potential energy surfaces. The proposed Ω-ERG method uses Slater determinants that are ordered according to seniority number Ω in ascending order. In the Ω-ERG procedure, the active system consists of M (N-electron) states and K additional complement (N-electron) states (complement-system). Among the M states in the active system the lowest-energy m states represent target states of interest (target-states), thus m ≤ M. The environment consists of Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) determinants that represent a reservoir from which the complement-states K are being selected. The goal of the Ω-ERG procedure is to obtain lowest-energy target states m of FCI quality in an iterative way at a reduced computational cost. In general, the convergence rate of Ω-ERG energies towards FCI values depends on m and M, thus, the notation Ω-ERG(m, M) is used. It is found that the Ω-ERG(m, M) method can be very effective for calculating lowest-energy m (ground and excited) target states when a sufficiently large number of sweeps is used. We find that the fastest convergence is observed when M > m. The performance of the Ω-ERG(m, M) procedure in describing strongly correlated molecular systems has been illustrated by examining bond-breaking processes in N2, H8, H2O and C2. The present, proof-of-principle study yields encouraging results for calculating multiple electronic states on potential energy surfaces with near Full CI quality.},

	abstract = {{The character of the 21Ag− for different molecular structures can be found in Fig. 3 and should be compared to Fig. 4 of the original article. For the DFT-optimized structures, the contribution from the doubly excited configuration HOMO2 → LUMO2 increases to approximately 50\\%--60\\%, while both singly excited configurations constitute 15\\%--25\\%. For longer polyene chain lengths, the contribution from the doubly excited configuration decreases. One major difference between the corrected results and the originally published data can be found for the character of the vertically excited states using the DMRG-optimized structures. Originally, the character of the first dark state was dominated by the HOMO → LUMO+1 excitation for longer polyene chain lengths, followed by the HOMO2 → LUMO2 excitation. With the corrected implementation, the vertically excited 21Ag− state becomes dominated by the HOMO−1 → LUMO excitation (gradually increasing from 35\\%--65\\%), while the HOMO2 → LUMO2 contribution gradually decreases from approximately 50\\% for C10H12 to less than 10\\% for C14H16. Similar to the original results, the picture changes completely when the molecular structure is allowed to relax. With the correct implementation, the contribution of the HOMO2 → LUMO2 excitation increases from 60 to roughly 70\\% compared to the previously reported data, while both singly excited configurations contribute approximately 10\\% to the first dark state of longer polyene chain lengths. Thus, the description of the 21Ag− state improves using the corrected implementation of EOM-pCCD+S, which explains the lower excitation energies for the first dark state compared to the original results.}},
